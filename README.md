<b>Overwie:</b>
In this project I want create a meteo station using two ESP32, DHT22 sesnor and OLED display.
One ESP32 will be act like server and it is going to measure temperature and humidiity using DHT22 sensor,
and server is going to advertise mesurments to the client (second ESP32) by Bluetooth Low Energy technology.
